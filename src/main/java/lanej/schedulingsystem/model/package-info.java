/**
 * Provides the model classes that represent the core business entities
 * of the scheduling system. They are mapped directly to the tables in an ERD diagram that
 * I was basing the software structure on. These classes define the primary data structures
 * used in the Scheduling application, capturing details about appointments, customers, contacts,
 * users, and related entities.
 *
 * <p>
 * The model package serves as the backbone for the system, ensuring data consistency
 * and encapsulating the properties and behaviors associated with each entity.
